I have hosted a live version of this presentation [on my site](http://nelsonliu.me/talks/linear_regression/linear_regression_tutorial.slides.html#).

## Running reveal.js Presentations
To run the presentations generated by `jupyter nbconvert`, you need a folder named `reveal.js` in the same directory as the `*.slides.html` file, the contents of which should be [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). I've included a git submodule of the version of reveal.js used at presentation time, but feel free to put in the latest copy / a version you like. Running this locally should be done with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
