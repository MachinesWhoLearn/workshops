# Introduction to Tensorflow

This folder contains the materials for a tutorial on Tensorflow,
presented at the Machines Who Learn meeting on May 8, 2017 by
[Nelson Liu](https://github.com/nelson-liu).


## Installing the requirements

These notebooks should be compatible with Python 2 and 3, but they were created
with Python 3.5.3 with Tensorflow 1.1.0 To install the requirements
for running the notebooks, run:

```
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```
